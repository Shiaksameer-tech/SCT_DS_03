# Task 03 - Decision Tree Classifier

This project is part of my internship at SkillCraft Technology.  
The goal is to build a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict customer behavior based on demographic and/or behavioral data.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** bank_data set uploaded in repo
## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Files
- `script.py`: Main script for preprocessing, training, and evaluating the model.
- `model_report.txt`: Accuracy and classification report of the trained model.
- `tree_visualization.png`: Visual representation of the decision tree (optional).
- `your_dataset.csv`: Dataset file (if uploading).
- `README.md`: This documentation.

## Output
Example accuracy: `0.85`  
Detailed classification report is included in the output file.
